                            <p> 
                                In a beautiful kingdom, a little girl called Ella lives a happy life in a lovely manor house with 
                                her doting parents. Her father, a wealthy merchant, is often away on business trips, 
                                but always makes the most of his time with his family. Ella's mother encourages her 
                                to believe in magic, courage, kindness, and hope. Ella considers the resident farm animals to be her 
                                dear friends, and talks to them often. Ella and her father are grief-stricken when Ella's mother falls 
                                gravely ill. On her deathbed, she tells her daughter, "have courage and be kind."

                                Long ago, two rival kingdoms sat side by side: The human kingdom, ruled by a power-hungry king, and the Moors, 
                                a peaceful place inhabited by many gentle supernatural creatures. One resident of the Moors is Maleficent, a young 
                                fairy girl with enormous wings, who acts as a guardian for the other magical beings.

                                Young Maleficent is alerted by three small fairies, Knotgrass, Flittle, and Thistlewit, that a thief has been 
                                apprehended by the forest guards at the borderline of the Moors.
