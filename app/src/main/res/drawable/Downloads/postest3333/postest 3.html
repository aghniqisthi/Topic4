                <b> Cinderella </b> <br>
                <p>
                    Cinderella is an ambitious young woman who wants to establish her shop "Dresses by Ella". 
                    One day in her patriarchal society, she catches the eye of Prince Robert in the guard-changing ceremony. 
                    The next day, Robert, dressed as a commoner, goes to the market, where he finds Ella trying to sell her dress. 
                    After some playful banter, he buys it for three times the amount she originally asked. He later invites her to the 
                    ball being held two weeks later, with the promise of introducing her to various people from the world to sell her 
                    dresses to.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    When the day arrives, Ella is getting ready when her stepmother, Vivian throws ink on her dress and tells her 
                    that only her stepsisters, Malvolia and Narissa, can attend, since Thomas the vegetable merchant has already 
                    confirmed his desire for Ella's hand. Ella is sad, but her Fabulous Godmother magically appears and dresses her in 
                    a design of Ella's, with glass shoes, and turns mice into footmen and a crate into a carriage. Ella goes to the ball 
                    and meets Tantiana, a visiting queen who offers to take her around the world as a dressmaker for her and asks to meet 
                    her the next day in the market square. Later, Robert finds Ella, shows his sister, Princess Gwen wearing the gown he 
                    bought from Ella previously and proposes to Ella. Ella refuses, however, as she wants to start her career. She tells 
                    that if she marries him it will be the end of her dream and Robert from his small age wanted to become the king and he 
                    also is not ready to accept this. At the stroke of midnight, she leaves the hall after throwing her shoe at one of the 
                    King's attendants, who tries to catch her.

                <b>Midnight Runners</b> <br>
                <p>
                    Ki-joon and Hee-yeol are students at the Korean National Police University. At around midnight one night, 
                    they witness a kidnapping on their way back from the club. The local police station's missing persons department, 
                    however, is busy with the kidnapping of a son of a business mogul at the time and is unable to investigate the case. 
                    Knowing that they are in the critical hours after a kidnapping, they embark on their own amateur investigation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When Ki-joon and Hee-yeol catch up with the kidnappers, it appears that the gang is running an unfertilized egg 
                    harvesting ring and there are many more girls locked up at their hideout. Ki-joon and Hee-yeol tries to save them 
                    but are instead beaten and locked up.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    After escaping their captors, they return the next day to an empty hideout and a cold trail. As they are not acting 
                    police officers, their professor tells them not to pursue the case any further. Unable to wait for the bureaucracy 
                    to resolve the case, they once again embark on their own investigation. They undergo heavy physical training and manage 
                    to track the kidnappers down, with the help of CCTV footage, to a fertility clinic. Armored up, the duo venture in to 
                    liberate the girls by themselves, this time much more prepared. They successfully take down all the kidnappers and 
                    their boss. Unable to arrest the kidnappers and rescue all the kidnapped girls themselves, they call the police in, 
                    knowing they might get expelled for their actions. However, due to some among the disciplinary committee believing 
                    that they had done the right thing morally, they are instead held back a year in their studies and sentenced to 500 
                    hours of community service, leaving the two satisfied with the outcome.

                <b>Maleficent</b> <br>
                <p>
                    Long ago, two rival kingdoms sat side by side: The human kingdom, ruled by a power-hungry king, and the Moors, 
                    a peaceful place inhabited by many gentle supernatural creatures. One resident of the Moors is Maleficent, a young 
                    fairy girl with enormous wings, who acts as a guardian for the other magical beings.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Young Maleficent is alerted by three small fairies, Knotgrass, Flittle, and Thistlewit, that a thief has been 
                    apprehended by the forest guards at the borderline of the Moors. The thief, a human boy called Stefan, returns 
                    the jewel he had taken and explains that he is an orphan with no real home. Maleficent forgives him and the two 
                    strike up a friendship that lasts for several years. On Maleficent's sixteenth birthday, Stefan gives her 
                    "true love's kiss," but then abandons her to pursue his thirst for power in the King's inner circle.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When Maleficent is grown, she is the primary guardian of the Moors. King Henry leads his army to conquer the Moors 
                    for the human world, but Maleficent victoriously counter-attacks with her band of magical creatures. King Henry is 
                    mortally wounded in the battle, and makes known his hatred for the winged woman who defends the Moors. Having only a 
                    daughter for an heir, King Henry promises her hand and the throne to whichever of his men brings proof of Maleficent's 
                    death. Stefan (now Sharlto Copley), despite his relationship with Maleficent, takes on the task in hopes of becoming 
                    the new king.
